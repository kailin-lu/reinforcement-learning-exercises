# Exercise 2.1 

In $\epsilon$-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and $\epsilon$ = 0.5, what is the probability that the greedy action is selected?

*Answer:*

P(greedy action selection) = P(greedy action | choose greedy action) + P(greedy action | don't choose greedy action) 

P(greedy action selection) = 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = .5 + .25  = 0.75
